A simple cross-device automatically syncing extension designed to save work on Google Classroom short-answer (question) posts.

## The problem

The short-answer questions on Google Classroom are used frequently by teachers, however work is not saved unless directly turned in. If you aren't careful, it can be extremely easy to lose hours of writing and paragraphs of text by accidentally reloading the page or closing the lid on your computer. Amongst my friends and peers, I have concluded that this is an experience all too common, most of whom claimed to have experienced it more than once.

## The solution

This Chrome Extension automatically saves your draft as you type, syncing across devices. For example, if you start your assignment on your Chromebook in school, your work will automatically appear on your home computer, phone, laptop, or other Chrome-compatible device using this extension.

## Features

Cross-device syncing: Pick up exactly where you left off.
Automatic saving: No more frantic last-minute saves.
Lightweight & discreet: Runs in the background to keep your work up-to-date.
