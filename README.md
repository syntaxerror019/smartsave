### A simple cross-device automatically syncing extension designed to save work on Google Classroom short-answer (question) posts.

## The problem

The short-answer questions on Google Classroom are used frequently by teachers, however work is not saved unless directly turned in. If you aren't careful, it can be extremely easy to lose hours of writing and paragraphs of text by accidentally reloading the page or closing the lid on your computer. Amongst my friends and peers, I have concluded that this is an experience all too common, most of whom claimed to have experienced it more than once.

## The solution

This Chrome Extension automatically saves your draft as you type, syncing across devices. For example, if you start your assignment on your Chromebook in school, your work will automatically appear on your home computer, phone, laptop, or other Chrome-compatible device using this extension.

## Features

Cross-device syncing: Pick up exactly where you left off.
Automatic saving: No more frantic last-minute saves.
Lightweight & discreet: Runs in the background to keep your work up-to-date.
Local: None of your information leaves the environment. Self-contained within [Chrome Storage](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/storage)

## Installation

As of writing this, the only way to get this Chrome extension is to download it yourself and load it to your browser. Luckily, this process is straightforward and can be done by anyone.

1) Download by pressing the green "Code" button and then "Download ZIP." Once done, extract the ZIP folder.
2) Open Google Chrome, and type `chrome://extensions` in the uppermost search bar.
3) Once loaded, toggle the Developer Mode switch ON at the top-right corner.
4) Press the new "Load Unpacked" button and select the unpacked/unzipped folder.
5) The extension will show up. Make sure the toggle is turned on to enable it.

## TODO

* Add cross-browser syncing (firefox, safari, etc.)
* Use a more robust saving system. (Backend DB)
